# LenovoFnMagnify Disable & Enable Registry

This is simply a repository for storage and sharing.

I created and saved a registry file based on the information shared in this blog [link](https://blog.carsoncheng.ca/2021/01/how-to-disable-lenovo-fn-tab-magnifier.html). Thank you Carson Cheng.

I created this repository for other users like myself suffering from Magnify programs popping up with unintentional hot keys (Fn+Tab).

To prevent Magnify from running with a hot key, simply download and run the .reg file.

Then have a nice day. Thank you.
