# Useful Registries
This is just a simple repository storage.
Those registries are useful to me. I hope it would be useful to you, too.


## EnableUnderClock Registry for Intel 12th+
Many devices with 12th generation or newer Intel CPUs can't control the voltage. For those who are offended by the device's heating, the clock can be limited, if not controlled.
To limit the clock (speed of CPU), add the registry and go to Control Panel\System and Security\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings.
Then click on the text link Change advanced power setting and use the clock limit for P and E cores that are newly added to the Processor Power Management item.

## Lenovo Fn+Tab Hotkey Disable Registry
I created and saved a registry file based on the information shared in this blog [link](https://blog.carsoncheng.ca/2021/01/how-to-disable-lenovo-fn-tab-magnifier.html). Thank you Carson Cheng.
To prevent Magnify from running with a hot key, simply download and run the .reg file.

## Windows Lock Screen Control
In standby mode, the lockscreen gives you time to relax while looking at cool images. But it also hurts your concentration when you get back to work.
Apply the Disable Windows 11 LockScreen registry to tear down the lockscreen. If you want to come back, you can apply the Enable Windows 11 LockScreen registry.


Then have a nice day. Thank you.
